	// The lifetime is not the revocation story, and neither the lifetime nor
	// the pod binding revokes an established connection. Two clocks, and it
	// matters which one a claim is about:
	//
	//   - A NEW connection. The pod binding governs this one. Once the pod
	//     object is gone the API server stops authenticating the token, so a
	//     stolen token buys nothing; measured at about ten seconds behind the
	//     delete, the TokenReview success cache rather than the hour below.
	//   - An ALREADY-OPEN connection. Nothing above touches it. The callout
	//     is consulted once, at CONNECT, and the grants it issued live in a
	//     signed user JWT the server holds for that connection; the server
	//     closes it when that JWT expires and at no other time. That is the
	//     callout's grant TTL — an hour less jitter, not this token's hour —
	//     and authcallout's TestANarrowedMapDoesNotReachAnEstablishedConnection
	//     pins the behaviour.
	//
	// So a harness that opens a second bus connection before its task ends
	// keeps that connection's grants for up to the grant TTL after the pod is
